## 1. Purpose of Declaration

This document defines and separates the roles of **human agency**, **tool-based language systems**, and **conscious intention** within the context of GPT and similar AI usage.  
It aims to clearly delineate the boundaries between **optimization mechanisms** and **intentional decision-making**.

## 2. Structural Definition

### Three-Element Framework: Human – Tool – Consciousness

| Element       | Role                    | Description                                                 |
|---------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Human**     | Decision-making agent   | Responsible for intention, choice, moral judgment           |
| **Tool**      | Operational interface   | Structured language system, command logic, processing flow  |
| **Consciousness** | Metacognitive awareness | Intention, control, feedback reflection                  |

## 3. Core Principles

### Principle 1: Irreducibility of Human Control  
> No matter how refined the tool, **conscious choice remains solely in the hands of the human**.  
> Tools can accelerate output, but **cannot originate purpose.**

### Principle 2: Structured Language Is a Means, Not Authority  
> Even highly structured systems like U-type-001 do
