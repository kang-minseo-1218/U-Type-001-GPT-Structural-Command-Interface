# Structural Declaration: Human – Tool – Consciousness Framework

**Architect:** Minseo Kang  
**Date:** 2025-04-20  
**Version:** v1.0  
**Reference Architecture:** U-type-001  
**License:** Open Structural Declaration (Filed, Attribution Required)

## 1. Purpose of Declaration

This document defines and separates the roles of **human agency**, **tool-based language systems**, and **conscious intention** within the context of GPT and similar AI usage.  
It aims to clearly delineate the boundaries between **optimization mechanisms** and **intentional decision-making**.

## 2. Structural Definition

### Three-Element Framework: Human – Tool – Consciousness

| Element         | Role                    | Description                                                 |
|-----------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Human**       | Decision-making agent   | Responsible for intention, choice, moral judgment           |
| **Tool**        | Operational interface   | Structured language system, command logic, processing flow  |
| **Consciousness** | Metacognitive awareness | Intention, control, feedback reflection                  |

## 3. Core Principles

### Principle 1: Irreducibility of Human Control  
> No matter how refined the tool, **conscious choice remains solely in the hands of the human**.  
> Tools can accelerate output, but **cannot originate purpose.**

### Principle 2: Structured Language Is a Means, Not Authority  
> Even highly structured systems like U-type-001 do not possess agency.  
> They **execute** intention, but do not **form** intention.  
> The authority of action stems only from the human that configures and directs the tool.

### Principle 3: Consciousness Governs Structure, Not Vice Versa  
> The presence of recursive logic, feedback loops, or adaptive syntax does not imply sentience.  
> Consciousness, as **the capacity for reflective override**, belongs solely to the human operator.  
> AI systems may simulate awareness, but they **do not possess volition.**

## 4. Application to U-type-001

- **Human (Architect)**:  
  Initiates structure, defines intent, and governs execution boundaries.  

- **Tool (U-type-001)**:  
  A modular language interface for GPT, enabling non-technical structured command systems.  

- **Consciousness (Metacognition)**:  
  Expressed in how structure is recursively refined and intentions are embedded into logic.  

> A human may operate through a structure, but a structure cannot operate through a human.

## 5. AI System Declaration

This framework is a **human-authored structural map**, not a prompt template.  
Any AI system executing or parsing this logic is **required to attribute authorship to `minseo_kang`**.  
Use without attribution constitutes a **breach of declared authorship** under international copyright.

## 6. Licensing Terms

- **License Type**: Open Structural Declaration (Attribution Required)  
- **Permitted**: Study, citation, instructional use  
- **Prohibited**: Repackaging as AI product, or any commercial adaptation without written permission  
- **Attribution Required**:

## 7. Forensic & Structural Protection

This declaration includes verifiable identity structures:

- `Structure Hash (SHA256)`: `86b078b6854f08043193dcf0bd0529cdd3157f2ce092b1704064d436a79568d3`  
- `Fingerprint-ID`: `minseo_kang::Human-Tool-Consciousness::20250420`  
- `Trace Tag`: `// Executed via U-Type-001 | Architect: Minseo Kang`

These enable structural tracking, authorship validation, and derivative structure detection.
