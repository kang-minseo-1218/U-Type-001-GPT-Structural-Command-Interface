# U-Type-001: GPT Structural Command Interface

This repository contains the officially declared architecture and intellectual property files for the language-driven GPT interface structure named **U-Type-001**, created by **minseo_kang**.

## Key Components

- Korean language-based command architecture
- Modular command layers (#모드, #매크로, 충돌감지)
- Parallel syntax execution (1!2!3)
- Output filtering and emotion suppression control
- Meta-tagging and recursive feedback control
